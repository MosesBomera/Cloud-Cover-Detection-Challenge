# [Cloud Cover Detection Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/83/cloud-cover/)
Satellite imagery is critical for a wide variety of applications from disaster management and recovery, to agriculture, to military intelligence. Clouds present a major obstacle for all of these use cases, and usually have to be identified and removed from a dataset before satellite imagery can be used. Improving methods of identifying clouds can unlock the potential of an unlimited range of satellite imagery use cases, enabling faster, more efficient, and more accurate image-based research.

In this challenge, the goal was to detect cloud cover in satellite imagery to remove cloud interference. I used a [Unet model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), through the [Segmentation Models](https://smp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a combination of Dice Loss and TverskyLoss. To aid efficient experiment iterations, I used [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/). As per the final leaderboard, I ranked 71 out of 847 participants.
